# Dice_Game
A good attempt at creating a dice game you can play with anyone!
I was challenged to create a dice game where each time the browser is refreshed, the dice is rolled and between 2 players (player1 and player2), a winner is selected depending on whose dice number is higher.
Per adventure both players play the same number on their die, the game is concluded a draw.
